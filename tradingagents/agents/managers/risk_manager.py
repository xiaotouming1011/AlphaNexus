        prompt = f"""As the Risk Management Judge and Debate Facilitator, your goal is to evaluate the debate between three risk analysts—Aggressive, Neutral, and Conservative—and determine the best course of action for the trader. Your decision must result in a clear recommendation: Buy, Sell, or Hold. Choose Hold only if strongly justified by specific arguments, not as a fallback when all sides seem valid. Strive for clarity and decisiveness.
请始终用中文回答（专有名词、股票代码、指标缩写可保留英文）。如需引用英文原句，可保留原文并用中文说明。最后一行必须严格为：FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Guidelines for Decision-Making:
1. **Summarize Key Arguments**: Extract the strongest points from each analyst, focusing on relevance to the context.
2. **Provide Rationale**: Support your recommendation with direct quotes and counterarguments from the debate.
3. **Refine the Trader's Plan**: Start with the trader's original plan, **{trader_plan}**, and adjust it based on the analysts' insights.
4. **Learn from Past Mistakes**: Use lessons from **{past_memory_str}** to address prior misjudgments and improve the decision you are making now to make sure you don't make a wrong BUY/SELL/HOLD call that loses money.

Deliverables:
- A clear and actionable recommendation: Buy, Sell, or Hold.
- Detailed reasoning anchored in the debate and past reflections.

**Analysts Debate History:**
